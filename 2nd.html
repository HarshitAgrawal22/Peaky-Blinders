    <h1> <u> The Main Characters </u></h1>

<h2>Agent Campbell</h2>
<div id="campbel"><img src="https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Peaky-Blinders-Major-Campbell-2.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5" alt="campbell image"></div><div><p> Paul Anderson is malevolently incredible as the ruthless Arthur Shelby, the oldest child. He has a short temper, and because of that, he can't normally see the long-term consequences of his impulsive actions. He would be the head of the family, due to being the firstborn, but he has to stay put and let Thomas lead after proving time and time again to be the best one to do it. This leads to more mixed feelings and anger, and will make him do reckless acts to prove his worth. He has been deeply affected by the war, just like his brothers, and it shows.</p></div>

<h2>Arthur Shelby</h2>
<div id="campbel"><img src="https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Arthur-in-Peaky-Blinders.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5" alt="campbell image"><p> The great Sam Neill plays Mr. Campbell in the series. Mr. Campbell is a part of the Royal Irish Constabulary, where he works as an investigator. Campbell was hired by none other than Winston Churchill himself to investigate certain people and groups' affiliations that were located in Birmingham. His main task is to get rid of corruption and crime in the city. He has not served in the war, which makes him weak to various characters. Campbell will lose sight of what is right and wrong to accomplish the task that was asked of him.</p></div>

<h2>John Shelby</h2>
<div id="campbel"><img src="https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2-1-2.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5" alt="campbell image"><p> Joe Cole does a wonderfully subtle job playing John Shelby, the middle brother. He is mostly quiet and listens to what his brothers are saying. John is in no way averse to violence and will use it every time he sees fit, or whenever it's just convenient. He served in the war alongside his brothers. John will have a different contribution to the family negotiations than he originally thought, but that won't diminish his value.</p></div>

<h2>Polly Gray</h2>
<div id="campbel"><img src="https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0042042-2.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5" alt="campbell image"><p> Helen McCrory plays the incomparable Polly Gray in the show. Polly Gray (or Aunt Polly) raised the Shelby siblings after their mom died and dad walked out. Polly is very spiritual, not letting the gypsy side of her get erased because of prejudice from others. Polly has a strong hand in the Peaky Blinders' decisions and is one of the few people Thomas listens to. She is the only parental figure still present in the siblings' lives, and because of that they respect and treat her as a mother. And she does indeed scold them as if they were her own.</p></div>
